\chapter*{Abstract}

In computer-aided verification, most of the tools leverage abstraction techniques to reduce the complexity of analyzed systems. Even though these techniques are widely adopted, they are usually tightly integrated into tools, causing undesired complexity, and neglect any reusable design.

In my research, I focus on the investigation of abstraction-based techniques used in program verification as abstract interpretation, counterexample guided abstraction or symbolic execution. For these techniques, I~devise self-contained alternatives and general-purpose analyses. As a~solution for self-contained abstraction, I propose a transformation-based method.
This method utilizes instrumentation to insert abstraction directly to the program, and consequently quits of responsibility for abstraction from the verification tools.

Up until now, I have developed transformation-based symbolic execution and string abstraction for explicit model checkers. In the future, I~plan to generalize the transformation-based technique for a wider variety of abstract domains such as predicate or pointer abstraction. Furthermore, I intend to adapt traditional abstraction refinement techniques to the self-contained abstraction.

In my research, I focus on the design of reusable abstraction for program
verification. The main objective of this design is to determine how to extract
abstraction out of dynamic analysis and still provide sufficient information
for program state-space exploration. In my work, I propose to let the program
under test take care of abstraction and maintain abstract data. This can be
achieved by instrumentation of abstract operations directly into the program.
Hence, the verifier does not need to perform abstract interpretation, but it
can only perform a concrete interpretation of the program and extract abstract
data from the program memory if it needs them.

In the previous chapter, I have stated multiple alternatives of how much of the
abstract interpretation is instrumented into the program and retained in the
interpreter.  As a reasonable boundary for reusable abstraction, I have
selected a design where metadata and decision procedure are part of the
execution engine (see \autoref{fig:bounds}). This choice balances an effort
required to integrate the transformation-based technique and load on execution
engine, where the instrumented code needs to be interpreted.

Up until now, I have focused on the general design of trans\-for\-mation-based
abstraction without refinement (\emph{trivially constrainable domains}). The
main concern of the first prototype was to design a general-purpose analysis
for instrumentation. The goal of these transformations was to allow coexistence
of concrete and abstract values in a single program. In this way, I was able to
extend model checker \divine~\cite{Divine17} with symbolic
computation~\cite{Lauko2019Sym, Lauko2018SymComp}.

All analyses presented in my up-to-date work are implemented in a tool named
\lart -- \llvm abstraction and refinement tool, that is a part of the \divine
project. \lart is based on top of the open-source \llvm compiler
infrastructure.  The latter is a well-maintained, well-documented, and
continuously improving framework. It allows \lart to easily integrate program
analyses, transformations, and other tools that target \llvm.

\section{Symbolic computation via Program Transformation}
\label{sec:symbolic}

\subsection{Abstraction Design}

The overall symbolic abstraction, depicted in \autoref{fig:design}, consists of
two parts: preprocessing (\emph{static analysis}), which performs
instrumentation of abstraction into the program; and verification
(\emph{dynamic analysis}) that explores the state space of the system under
test.

The instrumentation performs dataflow analysis of non-de\-ter\-ministic values and
replaces operations on them by their abstract counterparts. The instrumented
program is subsequently linked with a library that implements abstract
operations and provides definitions of abstract data representation.

During verification, virtual machine (\textsc{vm}) executes the abs\-trac\-ted
program and generates state space for a model checking algorithm (\textsc{mc}).
The model checking algorithm extracts symbolic data and path condition directly
from program memory, whenever it needs to decide whether the state is feasible
or is equal to some previously visited state. An external \smt solver solves
feasibility and equality queries. Notice that the virtual machine has no clue
about abstract values present in the program.

However, it needs to recognize what parts of the memory contains abstract data,
because they can not be compared explicitly when the model checker is
determining equality of states.\sidenote{A dedicated decision procedure
determines the equality of abstract values. In the case of symbolic values it is
a \smt solver.} Therefore, the virtual machine keeps metadata that denotes what
parts of memory hold abstract values.

\subsection{Term domain}

The abstract domain used for the symbolic computation was inspired by the
domain of uninterpreted functions~\cite{Gange2016} -- we call it a term domain.
In the term domain, the arithmetic operations build term trees (data
definitions) that represent relations between ground variables and constants,
whereas the branching conditions extends the global path condition.  For
further details, see papers in the attachments of the thesis
proposal~\cite{Lauko2018SymComp, Lauko2019Sym}.

\section{String Abstraction}
\label{sec:string}

My following publication has focused on the extension of the
transformation-based approach to non-scalar domains (i.e., aggregate domains).
An example of such a domain is a string domain. In cooperation with Martina
Olliaro, I have adapted her string domain (\textsc{mstring})~\cite{Olliaro2018}
as \lart domain. A \lart domain is a C or C++ library that provides
definitions of abstract values and implementation of supported operations on
them.

\textsc{Mstring} domain represents C strings by segmentation abstract domain
that keeps track of terminal zeros in the underlying array. It is a
parametrizable domain in the means of array segments\sidenote{Array segment
represents a consecutive area of the same characters.} length and array
content.  Hence, we have repurposed a symbolic domain from previous work to
abstract lengths of string segments.

To support aggregate domains \lart, I have adapted its data\-flow analysis to
support multiple domains and manipulations with \llvm arrays. Moreover, I have
extended the instrumentation to support abstraction of larger operations than
just \llvm instructions -- these occur in C string manipulating programs in the
form of functions (\texttt{strlen}, \texttt{strcmp}, \texttt{strcat}). The
transformation-based string abstraction is further presented in attached paper
~\cite{Lauko2019String}.
